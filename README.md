How to build it:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dark1510/zpaqfranz-Command-generator.git
cd zpaqfranz-Command-generator
gcc zpaqfranz_command_genV0.4.c -O2 -march=native -o zpaqfranz_command_gen
```
How to use it:

```
./zpaqfranz_command_gen
```

Nothing else to say 
other than that i was bored as hell 
and hated having to manually type out 
zpaqfranz commands.
